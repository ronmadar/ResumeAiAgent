Consider adding try-except blocks to handle potential errors.\n2. **Use more descriptive variable names**: Some variable names, such as `skills_match_percentage`, could be more descriptive. Consider using more specific and descriptive names.\n\n**Additional Recommendations**\n\nBased on the provided data, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Consider using a more advanced screening process**: While the current screening process provides useful insights, it may benefit from additional features, such as machine learning algorithms or natural language processing techniques.\n2. **Expand job matches**: The current job matches list is empty. Consider expanding this list to include more potential positions that align with the candidate's skills and experience.\n\nBy following these recommendations, you can improve the effectiveness of your screening process and increase the chances of finding a successful candidate for the position.", 'recommendation_timestamp': '2025-03-14', 'confidence_level': 'high'}}
